# hello-world
This is a short description. With purpose and intention of being descriptive!

Greetings and Felicitations!

I'm writing this as part of a GitHub tutorial! Why? Because I love to learn and know things! I'm a self-starter and a quick learner with a love of technology and science! 

My goal at present, professionally, is to acquire a job as a Software Developer! To assist that goal I am actively enrolled at Western Governors University and am working toward a BS in Software Development. I have 2 terms left after I finish up my current term. I've been learning Python and Java and LOVE coding! I have actively used VBA, C#, and a few other languages in the past, and am also familiar with HTML5, CSS, etc!

Goal complete in terms of College! I've now acquired the BS in Software Development and now of course am continueing to learn more! Done some Mobile app dev on Android, added some Django to my Python, and now I'm eying up Kotlin as well as getting deeper into C#! 

I love all things programming and have even begun teaching programming to youth in 4H starting them out in Scratch to being learning the basic concepts!! Awesome stuff!
