# hello-world
This is a short description. With purpose and intention of being descriptive!

Greetings and Felicitations!

I'm writing this as part of a GitHub tutorial! Why? Because I love to learn and know things! I'm a self-starter and a quick learner with a love of technology and science! 

My goal at present, professionally, is to acquire a job as a Software Developer! To assist that goal I am actively enrolled at Western Governors University and am working toward a BS in Software Development. I have 2 terms left after I finish up my current term. I've been learning Python and Java and LOVE coding! I have actively used VBA, C#, and a few other languages in the past, and am also familiar with HTML5, CSS, etc!
